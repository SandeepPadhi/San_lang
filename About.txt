This is my very own programming language.

Why would I want to do that?
->Because, I was extremely curious about a language is built.I wanted to feel those people who created their language.I craved the clarity that
thos people had.I wanted to among those view people who have implemented their own version of language.This doesnt contribute anyting to 
the programming community,but is preparation to able to contribute soon...I believe there are many more languages about to come and many languages 
are to be improved which they ofcourse do.I want wish to be one of them.


#Lexer
A lexer is the very first component of compiler.Which tries to find out individual atomic entities of the source code.
That is token.Every token has a type and optionally a value.
